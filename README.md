2/11 we're continuing to do matrix as well as math with it. The videos are starting to help me understand.

2/17 I watched the rest of the videos and finally added some commits to the repository, however I don't know if this adding to the repository.

2/17 Added NCAT-QISE 2023 to the GH file, I also went through and did the problems on the worksheets and rewrote my notes since the notes were posted on here as well.
