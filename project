What you want to do, what you have learned, what you have planned
I learned so far this year matrices and vector math as well as some addition python and some linear algebra. We did also go over gates and their properities especially when it interacts with matrics. I have plans to make a simple game of tic-tac toe before making an advance version of it
some articles down here, gave me background information as well as examples of what my codes should look like and which gates and matrices might be useful.
