#Readme (on Github) that contains all the things that we(you) have been reading on this topic. e.g., Using Qiskit to build a game, from the internet and from this class. Integrate the content into something of your own! 500 words? What you want to do, what you have learned, what you have planned?

I learned so far this year matrices and vector math as well as some addition python and some linear algebra. We did also go over gates and their properities especially when it interacts with matrics. I want to make a simple game and my plans to make a simple game of tic-tac toe before making an advance version of it will take a bit of time and preparation. I want to incorporate a 2-player game where they have to send their "code" to each other computer, basically to teleport their guess of where they want to put their 'X' or "O". Using matrices, such as hermitian matrices, and probably X or Z gates along with python, will make an overall boost in the gaming world and in the quatum world. I also want to make it so 1-player can face an AI auto-generated, however that is way too far into the future and will let a software-developer guide that area.

Some articles down here gave me background information as well as examples of what my codes should look like and which gates and matrices/vectors might be useful.

https://builtin.com/hardware/quantum-computer-games (Gave me some background information about the plausibility of a new world opening for the gaming world and that games such as minecraft can be made using quantum computing)
https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/07/hello-quantum/ (this one was featured in Kotaku, however, this article had showed me that it was actually plausibile to make a game)
https://www.qmunity.tech/tutorials/building-a-quantum-game (this one was especsially helpful as it taught me how to developed a quatum game, although i do not know if this will help in building a tic-tac-toe game.)
